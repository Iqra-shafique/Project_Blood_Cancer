# Blood Cancer Analysis Dashboard - Objective Questions

## Project Theme
**Data Visualization and Interactive Analysis of Blood Cancer Patient Demographics and Clinical Characteristics**

---

## Objective Questions (4-6)

### Q1: What is the demographic distribution of blood cancer patients?
**Objective:** Understand the age and gender composition of the patient population.

**Expected Insights:**
- Age range and distribution across patient cohorts
- Gender-based prevalence patterns
- Age group-wise patient counts
- Identification of high-risk age groups

**Dashboard Answer:** Age histogram, gender pie chart, demographic summary statistics

---

### Q2: How do clinical lab values (WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Platelets) vary across different blood cancer diagnoses?
**Objective:** Identify clinical biomarkers and their diagnostic significance.

**Expected Insights:**
- Lab value ranges for each cancer type
- Statistical differences between diagnoses
- Outlier patterns and severity indicators
- Clinical parameter correlations with diagnosis

**Dashboard Answer:** Box plots by diagnosis, scatter plots, statistical summaries, heatmaps

---

### Q3: Is there a significant correlation between patient age and clinical lab parameters?
**Objective:** Determine age-related patterns in blood cancer progression.

**Expected Insights:**
- How lab values change with patient age
- Age-specific risk factors
- Early detection indicators by age group
- Treatment recommendations based on age

**Dashboard Answer:** Correlation heatmap, age vs. lab values scatter plots, trend analysis

---

### Q4: What are the most common blood cancer diagnoses, and how do they differ in clinical presentation?
**Objective:** Compare diagnostic distributions and clinical characteristics across cancer types.

**Expected Insights:**
- Prevalence of each cancer type
- Unique lab value signatures for each diagnosis
- Gender-diagnosis associations
- Severity distribution by type

**Dashboard Answer:** Diagnosis bar charts, multi-variable comparisons, clinical profiles

---

### Q5: Are there gender-based differences in blood cancer diagnoses and clinical parameters?
**Objective:** Identify gender-specific patterns in blood cancer presentation.

**Expected Insights:**
- Gender distribution across diagnoses
- Gender-specific lab value ranges
- Differential presentation patterns
- Gender-based clinical insights

**Dashboard Answer:** Gender-wise box plots, cross-tabulation charts, demographic breakdowns

---

### Q6: What data quality and missing value patterns exist, and how do they impact analysis?
**Objective:** Ensure data integrity and identify potential biases in the dataset.

**Expected Insights:**
- Missing value distribution
- Data completeness by variable
- Potential data quality issues
- Impact on statistical validity
- Data cleaning decisions and rationale

**Dashboard Answer:** Missing value heatmap, data quality report, cleaning summary page
